## 🚩 The Problem
Education is expensive, and financing it is complicated.
- **Information Overload**: Students are bombarded with complex financial terms and hundreds of loan options.
- **Missed Opportunities**: Many eligible students miss out on scholarships simply because they don't know they exist.
- **Tedious Process**: Applying for aid requires filling out endless forms with the same information repeatedly.
- **Financial Stress**: Students often struggle to manage their day-to-day expenses while worrying about loan repayments.

## 💡 Our Solution
**EdBridge** is an intelligent, user-friendly platform designed to bridge the gap between students and their financial goals. We simplify the entire process of funding education and managing money.

Instead of a generic search engine, we provide a **personalized financial assistant** that understands your unique profile.

### How We Address the Issues:
1.  **AI-Powered Recommendations** 🤖
    -   **Fix**: Instead of searching through every bank's website, students enter their details once.
    -   **Result**: Our system analyzes their profile (grades, income, course) and matches them with the top 3 best loan options tailored specifically for them.

2.  **Smart Document Reading (OCR)** 📄
    -   **Fix**: Documentation is boring and prone to errors.
    -   **Result**: Students can simply upload a picture of their marksheet or ID card. Our system instantly reads the text and fills out the forms for them.

3.  **Scholarship Finder** 🔍
    -   **Fix**: Free money is often left on the table.
    -   **Result**: We scan for both government and private scholarships that match the student's specific category, income level, and academic performance.

4.  **Complete Financial Dashboard** 📊
    -   **Fix**: Budgeting is hard.
    -   **Result**: A beautiful, easy-to-read dashboard helps students track their loans, monthly expenses, and savings goals in one place.

5.  **24/7 AI Chatbot** 💬
    -   **Fix**: Financial jargon is confusing.
    -   **Result**: A friendly AI assistant is always available to answer questions like "What is an EMI?" or "How do I improve my credit score?" in simple language.

6.  **Smart Branch Locator** 📍
    -   **Fix**: Finding the nearest branch of a specific recommended bank is hassle.
    -   **Result**: We combine **Mapbox** maps with **Google GenAI Search** to find and display the exact physical branches of your recommended banks near you, complete with navigation.
